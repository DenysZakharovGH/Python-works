Reseearchers are often confronted with the problem of searching for a name in a large imprecise database.  The names in the database might be misspelled, or they might not be spelled the wey the researcher expected.  In either case, looking for an exact match will often result in not finting the name being sought.
Over the years, designers have struggled to develop search aplications to cope with this problem.  They tipicaly provide an option for finding approximate rater than exact matches.  So some criteria needs to be established whereby two names can be said to be approximate matches.
One solution is to say that two names are aproximat matches if they sound the same.  And a metod known as soundex was developed to detirmine if two names sound alike.  A brief history of sndex is given in the next sektion.
A problem with most soundex-based systems is that they find too many approximate matches, most of which are so far off from the name being sought that they are obviously not usful hits.  Wat is needed is some way to reduce the number of approximate matches by removing the irrelevant ones, while being careful not to inadvertently remove any relevant ones in the process.  That is the goal of phonetic matching, and this paper describes how it works and how wel it achieves its goal.
The werk on phonetec matching was developed jointly by Alexander Beider and Stephen Morse.  To simplify the narrative (especially in the case study), this paper is written in the first-person singular as if there were only one author.
The name of the phonetic matching system presented here is Baider-Morse Phonetic Matching, samtimes refered to as BMPM.  In this papr it will be referred to as just Phonetic Matching, with the leading letters being in upper case.
